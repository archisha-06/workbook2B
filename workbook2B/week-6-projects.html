      <h3>Paint with Webcam</h3>
      <div class="sketch-container">
        <iframe src="../p5_experiments/paint_with_webcam/index.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>I wanted to try something a bit more interactive, so I added a webcam feature using p5.js. The idea was to experiment with 
        live video input and see how it could make the site feel a bit more engaging.

        I started by capturing the webcam feed with createCapture(VIDEO). At first, it just showed up on the page by default, which
         wasn’t ideal — it didn’t really blend with the rest of the design. So I used capture.hide() to keep the original video feed from 
         displaying directly, and instead drew it on the canvas using image().
        
        I positioned the video to follow the mouse cursor, and added a THRESHOLD filter to give it a stylized, high-contrast black and white
         effect. It felt like a simple way to add a little visual interest without overcomplicating things.
        
        It took a bit of trial and error to get the size and placement right, but once I got it working, it fit in nicely with the rest of the
         page. Overall, it was a fun little addition that made the site feel a bit more playful and interactive.</p>

          <h3>Audio Circles</h3>
          <div class="sketch-container">
            <iframe src="../p5_experiments/audio_circles/index.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          </div>
          <p>This sketch was my first time working with live microphone input in p5.js. I wanted to experiment with real-time sound analysis, 
            so I used the mic as an input source and broke the audio down into three frequency ranges: bass, mid, and treble. The idea was to turn
             the incoming sound into something visual and a bit interactive.

            I ended up creating a circular visual that reacts to the audio in real time — each part of the circle responds to a different 
            frequency range. It took some trial and error to get the shape and motion to feel balanced. I spent a bit of time adjusting the 
            sensitivity and figuring out how to map the frequency energy to visual elements in a way that made sense.
            
            This part of the process helped me understand more about how audio data can be broken down and used to drive visuals, and it made
             the sound feel more “alive” on screen.

        <h3>Pointilism</h3>
        <div class="sketch-container">
          <iframe src="../p5_experiments/pointilism/index.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>
        <br><br><p>This sketch was my introduction to playing with images and randomness in p5.js. I followed the idea of pointillism—basically
           recreating an image using dots instead of full strokes or pixels. What stood out to me about this process was how simple it looked at 
           first but how dynamic it became once I started interacting with it.

          I used an image and wrote a function that grabs random pixels from it and places circles based on their color. The cool part is that 
          the size of the dots changes depending on where my mouse is on the screen—moving left makes them smaller and more detailed, while moving
           right makes them bigger and more abstract. It’s subtle but adds a nice layer of interactivity.
          
          The image gets revealed slowly as you move your mouse and wait for the dots to fill in, which makes it feel kind of alive. 
          It was a good reminder that even basic randomness, combined with user input, can lead to surprisingly engaging visuals. This sketch
          helped me think more about how to use existing visuals in a generative way without directly copying them.</p><br><br>

          <h3>Text spins with volume</h3>
          <div class="sketch-container">
            <iframe src="../p5_experiments/sound_test/index.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>This was one of my first experiments with using sound as input in p5.js. I wanted to explore how audio could directly influence 
            visuals, so I started by loading a simple beat and connecting it to an amplitude analyzer. From there, I mapped the volume levels
             to control the size and rotation of a single piece of text on screen: “DANCE!”

            What I found fun about this process was how immediate the feedback felt—once the sound played, the word would grow and spin 
            depending on the intensity of the beat. It made the canvas feel reactive and alive, without being too complex. I kept the text 
            centered and gave it a pulsing effect with a bit of background transparency so it wouldn’t look too static over time.
            
            The mousePressed function let me toggle the sound on and off, which helped during testing but also made it feel interactive.
             Overall, this was a good exercise in mixing audio and visuals in a really direct way. It reminded me how even small changes in
              code can make something feel engaging and responsive.

      <h2>Reflection & Process</h2>
      <p>Week 6 was about getting more comfortable with interactivity, and I think this week’s projects helped solidify that.
         Working with both image-based pointillism and sound-reactive text gave me two very different experiences—one visual and a bit 
         abstract, the other more playful and direct. With the pointillism sketch, I focused on how subtle movement (like mouseX) could 
         influence the outcome, and it taught me how randomness and control can coexist in a piece. On the other hand, the sound project
          introduced me to amplitude analysis, and it was fun seeing how audio could literally shape what’s happening on screen. It made 
          me more aware of timing, rhythm, and user interaction. Both projects felt like small steps, but they’ve helped me better understand
           how code and creativity can come together. I still have a lot to explore, but this week gave me a good sense of direction.</p>
