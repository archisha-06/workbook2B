      <h2>Overview of Week 5: Adding Images</h2>
      <p style="margin-left: 170px;">In Week 5, we learned how to load images in P5.JS and experimented it using different projects. I also 
        tried some other cool projects using code snippets from week 5.

      <h3>Workshop Activity: Adding webcam</h3>
      <div class="sketch-container">
        <iframe src="../p5_experiments/webcam/index.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>This week, I experimented with adding a webcam to my sketch using p5.js — something I’d never done before,
         so I wasn’t exactly sure how it would work. At first, I followed the usual approach: declaring the capture variable, 
         setting it up in the createCapture() function, and trying to draw it on the canvas. But of course, like most first attempts,
          it didn’t show up the way I expected.<br>

        Turns out, there are a few little things that matter a lot — like using capture.hide() to prevent the webcam’s default HTML 
        element from overlapping the canvas, and making sure to center the video using imageMode(CENTER) if I wanted it to sit neatly in the
         middle. Once I figured those parts out, it started to feel more intuitive.<br>
        
        I also added a THRESHOLD filter to the feed, which turned the live video into a stark black-and-white image. 
        It gave the webcam a bold, almost poster-like effect — something that looked way more artistic than I had imagined with just 
        a few lines of code.<br>
        
        Looking back, this process reminded me how small tweaks in code can make a huge difference in the outcome.
         Debugging can be frustrating, but it’s also kind of rewarding when it finally clicks.</p>

          <div class="sketch-container">

          </div><br><br><br>
          <p>This sketch was my attempt at playing with layers and interaction — specifically, the idea of revealing one image through 
            another using the mouse. I used two images stacked on top of each other: one as the base and another one completely covering it.
             The cool part? You can “scratch away” at the top image with your mouse to reveal what’s underneath — like a digital scratch card.<br>

            At first, I wasn’t sure how to achieve that effect. I knew I wanted the reveal to feel interactive and playful, 
            almost like peeling something off. After some experimenting (and re-reading the p5.js reference like 12 times), 
            I found that the copy() function was perfect for this. It let me take small patches of the top image and redraw them 
            directly under the cursor as I dragged the mouse.<br>
            
            One of the biggest surprises was how satisfying it felt — even with a super basic setup, the effect felt kind of magical. 
            It’s simple, but it invites the viewer to interact with the image in a way that feels personal. I can definitely see potential 
            in taking this further, maybe adding sound or dynamic brush shapes to make it even more immersive.</p><br><br><br>

        <div class="sketch-container">

        </div>
        <br><br><p>This little sketch was my first go at creating a digital dice roller — something super simple, 
          but surprisingly fun to build. The idea was to roll a number between 0 and 5 every time you click 
          (like rolling a 6-sided die), and display that number in the center of the screen.<br>

          I started with the basics: setting up the canvas, choosing a bright blue background (because why not), 
          and making the number show up nice and bold with a big text size. The actual "dice roll" part was just using random(6) 
          and converting that to an integer. It felt cool to have that tiny moment of unpredictability every time I clicked.<br>
          
          I originally planned to use the spacebar to trigger the roll, but then decided mouse clicks were easier to test quickly. 
          I might go back and experiment with adding dice graphics or even a rolling animation later. But for now, this version feels playful 
          — kind of like a digital fidget toy. It reminded me that even with a few lines of code,
           you can make something interactive and satisfying.</p><br><br>

          <h3>Text to Points</h3>

            <iframe src="../p5_experiments/text_to_points/index.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>This sketch was my first experiment using custom fonts and point manipulation in p5.js —
             and it turned out to be a surprisingly poetic little piece. I wanted to write something simple like "I Love You!"
              but make the letters feel alive and responsive, so I used a font converter with textToPoints() to break the phrase 
              into coordinates.<br>

            At first, seeing the phrase built entirely from points was oddly exciting — almost like I had access to its skeleton. 
            Then I started playing with interactivity. I mapped the mouse's horizontal movement to change the blue tint and size of 
            the circles that form each letter. Suddenly the text felt like it was breathing or reacting emotionally, which gave it a 
            kind of quiet intimacy.<br>
            
            This project helped me understand the link between typography and generative art — how something as personal as a message 
            can be turned into a dynamic visual experience with just a few tweaks. It’s one of those sketches that looks simple, but 
            feels deeper the longer you play with it.

          </div>
          <br><br><p>This sketch is a playful self-portrait I created using p5.js. I kept things simple, using basic shapes to build the features
             — from the blushy cheeks to the oversized specs that are very me. What makes this portrait special is that the glasses are
              interactive: you can click and drag them around my face.<br>

            The idea was to reflect not just how I look, but a bit of how I feel — a little quirky,
             always adjusting how I see the world. Making the glasses movable felt symbolic, like giving the viewer a tiny piece of 
             control over my perspective (or at least my fashion choices).<br>
            
            It was a fun and surprisingly reflective process. I learned a lot about layering, shape alignment, and how just a small
             interactive element can bring a static image to life. Seeing myself represented this way — in code and creativity — felt
              kind of empowering.

        <br><br><p>In this sketch, I experimented with layering two images and letting the user "paint" with them using their mouse.
           When the mouse is pressed, one image appears under the cursor, and when it's not, it switches to another — kind of like
            flipping between two moods or moments. It reminded me a bit of digital collage-making or memory layering, where the same space 
            can hold multiple visuals depending on how you interact with it.<br>

          What I enjoyed about this was how simple logic in code — just a mouse press condition — could create such an intuitive,
           tactile experience. Playing around with the image sizes and ratios also taught me more about how images behave when stretched
            or transformed in p5.js.<br>
          
          This was a fun way to combine visuals with interaction and explore how subtle changes in input can shift the entire outcome.

      <h2>Reflection & Process</h2>
      <p>This week, I used p5.js to experiment with different ideas — from layering images and adding webcam effects, 
        to making simple interactive sketches like a dice roller and a moving glasses portrait.<br>

        Getting the webcam to work was a bit tricky at first, but I eventually figured it out. It was cool to see how small 
        changes in code could create interesting effects. I also tried using textToPoints to turn text into dots, which added a fun 
        visual element.<br>
        
        Overall, it was a productive week. I learned more about how p5.js works, and I got to try out new things while organizing my 
        work in one place. There’s still a lot to do, but it feels like I’m getting the hang of it.</p>
