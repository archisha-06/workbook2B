      <h2>Overview of Week 5: Coding Home-page and illustrations</h2>
      <p style="margin-left: 170px;">In Week 5, I started working on building my Workbook 2B website using HTML, CSS and P5.JS. I wanted to implement
        my understanding on P5.js in my website elements as well, so I decided to code all the illustrations and interactive elements
      </p>

      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="../workbook2B/images/html-homePage.png" style="width: 1000px; height: auto;">
      </div><br>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 150px;">I began by defining the overall aesthetic and color scheme of the website.
         I chose a tech-futuristic typeface to complement the theme and carefully positioned the initial text elements to 
         establish a clear visual hierarchy and layout.

      <div class="project" id="paint-an-img">
          <h3>Adding trail on cursor</h3>
          <div class="image-container">
            <iframe src="grid_trail/index.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          </div><br><br>
          <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 150px;">To give my website a more dynamic, digital personality, I created a custom cursor trail using p5.js. 
            Every time the mouse moves, it leaves behind a crosshair-like grid that fades out gradually, creating a 
            subtle techy shimmer across the page. I wanted something that felt responsive but not overwhelming — something 
            that visually follows the user without being too literal.<br>

            Instead of using background(), I opted for clear() so the rest of the site stays visible underneath the canvas.
             Each “particle” is a simple grid made of intersecting lines with decreasing opacity — a low-key nod to classic sci-fi UI design.
              It’s also layered behind all site content using a negative z-index, making it feel integrated into the overall vibe of the site 
              rather than just an animation floating on top. </p><br><br>

        <h3>Header Illustration</h3>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../workbook2B/assets/header-1.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;">
          <img src="../workbook2B/assets/header-2.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;">
        </div>
        <br><br><p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 150px;">Before landing on the final design, I actually went through a few different ideas. I tried some more minimal sketches, 
          experimented with bright colours, even played around with geometric shapes fading in and out — but none of them really clicked. 
          They either felt too static or didn’t match the energy I wanted my site to give off.<br>

          </p><br><br>
          <div class="video-container">
            <video autoplay muted loop>
                <source src="../workbook2B/assets/header-final.MOV" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
        </div>
        <br><br><p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 150px;">Eventually, I built this — a glowing, rotating web of 3D particles 
          using p5.js and WebGL. As soon as I saw it in motion, I knew this was it. It had the cyber feel I was after — like a floating neural 
          network or a piece of interactive sci-fi architecture.<br>

          The sketch is made up of hundreds of particles randomly placed in 3D space. When they're close enough to each other, they connect with
           fine neon lines, forming an evolving network that rotates gently on the Y and X axis. The whole thing runs behind the header and adapts
            to the window size — which took some fiddling to get right, but was worth it.<br>
          
          What I like most is how it captures a sense of motion and curiosity without being overwhelming. It's just subtle enough to
           live behind the content but still gives the site that futuristic, slightly mysterious vibe.<br>

          <br>
          <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 150px;">To link each week of my progress, I created three rotating 3D shapes using p5.js — a box, a sphere, and a cone — each sitting
             in their own little canvas. I liked the idea of giving every week its own visual identity, and these shapes felt like a fun and
              abstract way to represent each phase.<br>

            Each one rotates around a different axis (Y for the cube, X for the sphere, and Z for the cone), which gives them a subtle sense 
            of individuality while still feeling like part of a cohesive set. I chose vibrant neon colors on a dark background to give them a 
            futuristic, digital look that fits with the rest of my site’s style.<br>
            
            I also added a hover effect using CSS — when you hover over a shape, it scales up slightly and glows more intensely. It’s a small 
            interaction, but it adds personality and makes the whole page feel more alive.<br>
            
            That said, getting these sketches to align properly was not as straightforward as I expected. Each canvas had its own quirks with 
            spacing and margins, especially since they were generated dynamically with WebGL. I spent quite a bit of time fiddling with layout 
            and container styles to get them to sit nicely next to each other. It was one of those behind-the-scenes struggles that no one really
             sees, but it definitely tested my patience.<br>
            
            In the end, I’m glad I pushed through — the result feels clean, interactive, and uniquely mine.<br><br>
            
            
            
            </p>
            <div class="video-container">
              <video autoplay muted loop>
                  <source src="../workbook2B/assets/final-home-page.mov" type="video/mp4">
              </video>
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 150px;">After getting all the interactive sketches working, I spent some time thinking 
            about how to bring everything together. I didn’t want the homepage to feel like just a random collection of experiments — I wanted 
            it to have flow, to guide people through my work and give a clear sense of progression.<br>

            So I started by adding direct links underneath each sketch, leading to the separate weekly pages. This way, the sketches weren’t 
            just visuals — they became clickable entry points into my process. I tried to keep the layout clean and the typography consistent,
            just so everything felt intentional and easy to navigate.<br>
            
            Finally, I added a looping background video. This was something I debated for a while — I didn’t want it to overpower the content,
             but I also felt like a bit of subtle motion could tie everything together nicely. I chose something minimal and ambient, and layered 
             it behind the main content using CSS positioning. It really helped set a tone for the site — slightly futuristic, a bit reflective, 
             and still grounded in the work.<br>
            
            This last stage made the biggest difference. Suddenly, all the separate elements started to feel like parts of a whole. 
            The site felt more like a portfolio and less like a sketchbook — still playful, but with a sense of intention and clarity.
